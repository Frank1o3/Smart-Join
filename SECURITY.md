## Reporting a Security Issue

Found a security problem? Here's how to report it:

### 🐛 How to Report

**Open a GitHub Issue** at [github.com/Frank1o3/Smart-Join/issues](https://github.com/Frank1o3/Smart-Join/issues/new)

- Use a clear title like "Security: [Brief Description]"
- Describe what you found and how it could be a problem
- Include steps to reproduce if possible
- Feel free to suggest a fix if you have ideas!

### ⏱️ Response Time

Smart Join is maintained by a solo developer, so please be patient:

- **Initial response:** Within 1 week i hope
- **Fix timeline:** Varies by severity and complexity
  - Simple fixes: 1-2 weeks
  - Complex issues: 2-4 weeks or longer
  - Critical security issues: As fast as possible!

I'll do my best to address security issues promptly, but response times may vary depending on my availability and other commitments.

### 🔒 For Serious Vulnerabilities

If you've found something **extremely serious** that could harm users right now:
- Consider using GitHub's private [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Frank1o3/Smart-Join/security/advisories/new) feature
- This keeps the issue private until a fix is ready

For most issues though, a regular GitHub issue is totally fine!

## Security Best Practices

To stay safe while using Smart Join:

- ✅ Download only from official sources (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or GitHub)
- ✅ Keep the extension updated
- ✅ Review what permissions the extension asks for
- ✅ Report anything suspicious
