    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: December 19, 2025</p>

    <p>Smart Join ("the Extension") is designed to help Roblox players find and join optimal game servers. This Privacy
        Policy explains what information the Extension collects and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>No personal data collection:</strong> The Extension does not collect or transmit any personal data or
        usage telemetry to a remote server by default.</p>

    <h2>Local Data</h2>
    <p>The Extension may store settings locally using the browser's storage APIs (for example, preferences about sorting
        or filtering). This data remains local to the user's browser and is not sent to external services.</p>

    <h2>Third-party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not use analytics or third-party trackers. If the Extension integrates a third-party service
        in the future, this policy will be updated and the change will be reflected here.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We follow reasonable practices to protect locally stored data within the user's browser environment, but we
        cannot guarantee absolute security—extensions run in the user's browser environment and depend on browser
        security.</p>

    <h2>Contact / Requests</h2>
    <p>For privacy inquiries or to request deletion of any stored data, open an issue at the project's <a
            href="https://github.com/Frank1o3/Smart-Join/issues">GitHub Issues</a> or email the repository owner via the
        contact information listed in the repository.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the Effective date at the top of
        this page.</p>
