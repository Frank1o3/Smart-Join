Smart Join — static site

This folder contains the static site used for the extension homepage and support pages.

- Update links in `src/manifest.json` if you fork or change the GitHub username.
- Build the version file with `npm run build:site`.
- The repo includes a GitHub Action that publishes `site/` to `gh-pages` on push to `main`.

Support form: `support.html` opens a prefilled GitHub issue at `https://github.com/Frank1o3/Smart-Join/issues/new`.
